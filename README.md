# Medical Payment With Open Source Data

The following link is to my project writeup: https://medium.com/@yw4142/open-medical-payment-analysis-with-hdfs-apache-spark-d3-and-vega-lite-react-js-f51f51f12ec1

## HDFS Data Cleaning and Processing
The folder spark_cmd contains all my Apache Spark command lines useing scala.

## Data Visulization
I used D3 and React.js to visulize a US map with color scheme to represent different states.

I used Vega-Lite and React.js to visulize level of payment vs. level of care comapred by state.
